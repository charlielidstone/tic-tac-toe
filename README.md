# tic-tac-toe

Console-based tic-tac-toe game written in C++.

Currently working on the bot which uses a minimax algorithm. Planning to add alpha-beta prunning though it may not may much difference for such a simple game.

I just run it through Visual Studio, I haven't yet bothered to install a standalone C++ compiler yet because it seems like a pretty tedious task.
